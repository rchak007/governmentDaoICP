This project is created as a concept where citizens can directly vote on main issues/areas where they want the government to spend money on.

Right now it does not have all the bells and whistles but something that is to be expanded upon. So there are some things that are arbitrarily decided.

The idea is the main issues like Education, Healthcare, Welfare, Infrastructure etc. are voted by citizens. Each citizen starts with 1000 points which are minted as tokens. they can vote more points on more important issues to them.

There will be a 6 months expiry once an issue is created.
